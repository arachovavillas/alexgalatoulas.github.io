Regenerative design and Biophilia, an innovative approach to NHS Infrastructure.

One of today’s challenges for NHS is the current financial crisis, rising costs of services, energy and supplies; innovations and technological breakthroughs that require more investment along with higher numbers of people to cater for. It is estimated that without radical changes to the way the system works, as demand rises, and costs rise too, the NHS will become unsustainable, with huge financial pressures and debts. If we make no changes we face a £30 billion funding gap for the NHS nationally by 2020.
Reading the Business Plans published by practices as well as hospitals, it was evident that the NHS is suffering from generating the required monies. The emphasis in the business plan was on how to address the current economic changes. In the same documents for a particular batch of Hospitals in England it was highlighted that:


•	34% reported the length of wait as unacceptable
•	31% said they have received good care managing their long term condition
•	20% of our people choose A&E rather than GP


It is evident from the findings available that the targets for many Hospitals are to:
•	Create Value
•	Improve patient satisfaction
•	Increase staff productivity 
•	Improve staff working conditions
•	Reduce “hard” and “soft” waste in their operations


In their effort to address the targets, it was noticed that their primary focus is on how to optimise and achieve economic sustainability through their clinical and health services.
In the Capital Plan issued for the same batch of hospitals, it was noticed that the programme spend was increased by 9.1% due to the increase in slippage late in the previous financial year.
It was observed that there was a minor mention on how the NHS can improve the operational and maintenance costs of their infrastructure. Although it is recognised in their corporate objectives that the improvement of their Estates is essential, there are no specific recommendations or objectives on how to achieve that.
Their estate capital plan corresponds to approx. 5.5% of the overall plan.
These indicators suggest that we, as industry representatives, have the duty to suggest strategies that will allow a potential client to create value and unlock possible available funds (direct and indirect) to support their saving plans and their operations as outlined in the business plan.


The scope of the following strategies is to demonstrate that their application can have direct savings to the Estate expenditure and indirect savings to the Estate but linked to patient care and staff expenditure. For example, 


•	Direct Savings: Regenerative design processes have direct impacts on the operational and maintenance costs of the hospital estates. 


•	Indirect Savings: Biophilic design practices can impose indirect savings by improving patient recovery time, by improving staff productivity, by reducing the amount of analgesic medication medicated and by promote healthier community living.


Regenerative design strategies (direct savings):


Buildings are by default “leaky” products, in terms of airflows and heat/cooling retention. As shown in Figure 1, the ultimate goal is to promote design strategies that will not only increase the efficiency of the operational systems of the building, but to push the envelope to net zero energy and water consumption.

Although this could prove challenging for a hospital environment, the design principles should be able to identify the limits that satisfy the available technological equipment, budget available and the socioeconomic impacts to the end user of the building. 
Major contributors to energy consumption are space heating/cooling, hot water and “plug” loads. Insulation of the building envelope is also a critical factor which is linked to the level of it’s air tightness. The majority of current regulations and certification products are lenient in this area with the exception of the Living Building Challenge and PassivHaus.  
Regenerative design processes have direct impacts on the operational and maintenance costs of the hospital estates. 


Biophilic design strategies (indirect savings):


Biophilic design, therefore, is based on the attempt to transfer the innate inclination of individuals towards natural systems and processes—biophilia (Kellert et al. 2008). Supporting research over the last 25 years demonstrates that the biophilic hypothesis has merit. Incorporating the smallest elements of biophilia into the healthcare industry can:


•	Improve patient recovery time.
•	Staff productivity.
•	Reduction of analgesic medication.
•	Promote healthier community living.


According to Ulrich’s research, looking at greenery and nature reduces hospitalisation time by 8% (Ulrich 1984). In the past, the NHS have paid private hospitals approx. £100m to treat patients as part of efforts to cut waiting times and maintain patient care to high standards. The operations costs would be 43% less if they had been done on the NHS.  That 8% recovery time reduction could limit the need for subcontracting private hospitals.


In 1996, a study of Beauchemin and Hays showed that patients suffering from bipolar disorder and depression, when subject to a hospital implementing Biophilic strategies, their average time of stay was reduced by almost 2.6 days.
The “2005 Sunlight and Health Study (Walch et al, 2005) demonstrated that natural light affects serotonin levels, this effect reduces the amount of analgesic medication and painkillers prescribed to patients.


Biophilia does not only benefits the patients; it is well known that doctors, nurses and staff have long hours in very stressful environments. It has been demonstrated that poor design and lack of exposure to nature also hinders blood pressure stabilisation and exacerbate anxiety. Increases in stress levels to hospital staff arise when there is a high level of responsibility and an inability to alter surroundings and take a break. These were part of the findings as presented by Sandler et al, 2008.


As Biophilic design choices also boost the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system, thereby decreasing stress levels and encouraging a general sense of well-being. By promoting staff’s health, biophilic design helps to reduce sick leave, while improving satisfaction and attention levels (Browning et al. 2012; Heerwagen 2000; Raanaas et al. 2011; Ikei et al. 2014; Nieuwenhuis et al. 2014).


Award winning Case study:


![whaterver](/img/khooteck1.png)


Designed as a V-shaped configuration of blocks, delineating a central court. The ‘V’ opened to the north, letting in breezes that first, skim over an existing storm-water pond, adjacent to the hospital site. To tap into this natural airflow, the envelope of the buildings had to calibrate permeability and shade. The goal was to allow patients access to natural light, cooling breezes and views, without risk of solar glare or rain entry.


Designed to be ‘forest-like’, water features with aquatic species, and plants that attract birds and butterflies were introduced. Greenery extended from the central courtyard to upper levels of the buildings and down into the open-to-sky basement, creating the impression of architecture deeply enmeshed in a garden. At the upper levels, balconies with scented plants bring the experience to the patient’s bedside.


Remarkably for a development located in a dense urban setting, KTPH managed to achieve a green plot ratio of 3.92; this meant that the total surface area of horizontal and vertical greenery is almost four times the size of the land that the hospital sits on. In addition, 18% of the hospital’s floor area account for blue-green spaces and 40% of all such spaces are publicly accessible.
In 2005, mid-way through design, the KTPH team expanded the hospital’s blue-green footprint by ‘adopting’ the adjacent storm water pond. Collaborating with other government agencies, the hospital team worked out a cost-sharing arrangement whereby the pond redesigned as a park would serve multiple groups within Yishun. The concrete edges of the pond were deconstructed and aquatic plants were introduced to clean the water and create habitats. A walking trail was added, linking the park to the hospital and a nearby residential estate. Following the incorporation of the pond, total blue-green space available to KTPH patients and visitors increased by 400%.

Concluding remarks:


In conclusion, it is important for these strategies to be communicated as early as possible in in the project lifecycle. These strategies must be part of the ERs as well as the project specific brief.
Regenerative design processes have direct impacts on the operational and maintenance costs of the hospital estates. 
Furthermore, evidence (research from 1981 -2014, as mentioned above) suggests that natural light, access to nature, and views of nature should be incorporated into design for Healthcare facilities. While there are initial upfront costs to this design the payback is quantifiable to allocated capital funds but more importantly, to the patients and the staff.
These strategies not only will futureproof this investment but they will also assist the Hospital funds to meet their saving targets while improving patient care and staff satisfaction.
