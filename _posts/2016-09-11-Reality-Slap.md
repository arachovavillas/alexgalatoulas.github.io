What lived and died on Earth depended on two principles: natural selection and random mutation. Then the human race was evolved to dominate and bring changes in many of the pre-existing functions of our eco-system. We developed tools and technologies from landing to a different planet, up to hybridizing plants. However, we have not figure yet out the benefits of providing clean forms of energy to the buildings that provide the roof to all of these technological victories.

Year 2016 was set to be the hottest year on record, is quite clear that we stand upon a climate castrophe. If we are really trying to reduce CO2 emissions why we keep designing and financing buildings that require a constant supply of energy made predominantly by burning fossil fuels? Professor Sir David King in a BBC radio interview had once said that: “Climate change is the biggest threat that our civilisation has ever had to face up to”. By this statement is pretty obvious that the threat is real but yet it seems difficult for people to grasp this fact and act upon it. 

An average person in a developed country consumes approximately 125kWh per day (that means an iPhone 6 would need to be charged 18,572 times a day!). If the daily amount of energy consumption is being increased, could it be ever possible to have buildings to operate in a net-positive environment? Could solar energy be enough to power our homes or even our offices? 

Well, the answer is simply yes. For those readers that are still in the cynic belief that this is another post based on sci-fi beliefs, the following cases would prove otherwise.

The Mission Zero House is a good example. A Victorian-era home which was restored to Net Zero Energy, Net Zero Water and ultimately made the building a learning tool for the community in both spirit and ecology. A visitor would never recognize the house as a typical “green” house, which was an intentional aspect of the design. The only giveaway to the unique rehabilitation of the historic Mission Zero House design is the photovoltaic array on the roof. The house actual energy usage is 8,676 kWh/yr and its production is 8,939 kWh/yr!

Before the cynics attack this example by saying, “Well this is a residential building! It would never work in a large scale office building!”. The Bullit Center in Seattle, Washington is a brilliant example of a six storey office building.

The Bullitt Center is powered by a 244 kW rooftop solar array, composed of 575 PV panels. All rainwater that falls on the site is collected in a cistern in the basement, treated to potable drinking standards, and supplies all water needs of the building. The building is a type-IV heavy timber structure, made of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified glulam beams and dimensional lumber. The building sits atop a ground-source heat exchange system made up of 26 wells, each reaching a depth 400 feet. All materials used in the building were screened for compliance with the Materials Red List to restrict toxic chemicals. 

Therefore, all the above make me think. Have we (as human race) been so busy creating sophisticated technologies that we left other layers of our own existence under-developed? Like the ability of using these technologies in a way that will satisfy not only our business plan but also our environmental obligations to the next generations. Is the rate of people creating these tools and technologies, greater than the rate of people re-assessing the way we are using these technologies? If not then why people are in denial of using sustainable means of energy to power our homes or our life’s day to day activities? 

Clean energy is not only good environmental practise but is also economic common sense. Why do we prefer to spend money on powering our homes while we could maximise any free input from renewables and use the savings to tackle other issues of our social existence (unfortunately there are many).

In my personal opinion I think all people have the means to design living eco-systems that will be our homes and offices. Hence, the crude headline of this post is that,it is possible in today’s technology to create buildings that are “living” entities!

However, we keep choosing buildings that proudly stand behind their nice facades, doing mostly nothing. Waiting to be supplied with energy as a beggar who needs change. 

We have the means and the tools to re-program the course of our nature and our future. Don’t we really need to think how to do it wisely? So the aim of this blog will be to inform and hopefully educate people through examples, study cases, and research on how this can be achieved. I hope on this journey that there will be people that will share their thoughts and knowledge.
