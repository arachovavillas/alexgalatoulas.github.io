What if every single act of design and construction made the world a better place?

The Living Building Challenge is the worldâ€™s most rigorous proven performance standard for buildings, a regenerative design framework to create spaces that, like a flower, give more than they take.

We would like to invite you to our first event and launch of a Living Building Challenge London Collaborative. You can reserve your place for the event through the link below,
