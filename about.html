## Welcome

Arachova Villas welcomes you to an mountain retreat in an environment filled with elegance, privacy and uncompromising views. 

Nestled on Mt Parnassos, Arachova is a town that has been transformed into a popular destination for those seeking winter sports and relaxation. 

It sits at an altitude of 973 meters and thanks to its proximity to Athens, the winter months see it buzzing on weekends with city slickers escaping the rat race for a break in the refreshing mountain air. 

Arachova Villas offers close proximity to the country's largest ski resort (18mins drive) for those who seek the adventure and for those who seek a relaxing walk to the traditional town centre (8mins drive).
