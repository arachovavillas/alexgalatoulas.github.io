## Welcome

Arachova Villas welcomes you to an mountain retreat in an environment filled with elegance, privacy and uncompromising views. 

Nestled on Mt Parnassos, Arachova is a town that has been transformed into a popular destination for those seeking winter sports and relaxation. It sits at an altitude of 973 meters and thanks to its proximity to Athens, the winter months see it buzzing on weekends with city slickers escaping the rat race for a break in the refreshing mountain air. For those who seek the adventure, Arachova Villas offers close proximity to the country's largest ski resort (18mins drive) and for those who seek to explore the traditional and historic town centre it is just less than 10mins.
