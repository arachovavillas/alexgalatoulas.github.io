## Welcome

Arachova Villas welcomes you to a mountain retreat in an environment filled with elegance, privacy and uncompromising views. 

Nestled on Mt Parnassos, Arachova is a town that has been transformed into a popular destination for those seeking winter sports and relaxation. It sits at an altitude of about 1000 meters and thanks to its proximity to Athens, the winter months it is buzzing on weekends with people escaping from the city for a break in the refreshing mountain air. For those who seek the adventure, Arachova Villas offers close proximity to the country's largest ski resort (18mins drive). For those who seek to explore the traditional town centre and enjoy the local cuisine it is about 10mins drive.
